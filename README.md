Repo for the submission of the Johns Hopkins' Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

## Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Making Modifications to This Script
You may not need to install and load the dplyr and reshape2 packages if they are already installed to your environment or loaded to your workspace. See lines 11:14 of run_analysis.R and delete or modify as necessary.

## Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions as per the Coursera project instructions.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file located [here](https://github.com/ayashchin/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/CodeBook.md).
